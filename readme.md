# GDB Flee

## A simple web service for helping your data flee File Geodatabases.

### Example
If you just want to help your data flee, give [this app][app] a try. The app's [about][about] page gives some more details about the how and why of this.

### Deployment
This repo is built to work with [Red Hat Open Shift][openshift]. The libs directory contains pre-built copies of [gdal][gdal], [geos][geos], and [proj][proj]. You will need to download the [File Geodatabase SDK][fgdb] for and copy the .so files into `$HOME/app-root/data/gdb/lib`.

In other environments, as long as python can see the above libraries, it should work.

### Todo

- Better error handling
- API
